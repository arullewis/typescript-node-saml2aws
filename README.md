# Dev Container for Typescript, Node with AWS & SAML2AWS CLI

This devcontainer uses the microsoft standard node development container. However i added a post install
script to install saml2aws. 


Steps:
- create a .devcontainer folder under the root folder of the repository.
- add .devcontainer folder to gitignore.
- copy devcontainer.json and postcreate.sh to .devcontainer folder.
- install devcontainer vscode plugin and use the vscode command pallette to build the container
- start vscode with devcontainer.


If you have any suggestion, please raise a pull request and i will merge it in. Thanks.
